     In the first thirty-five years after Erich Blair, known more 

commonly as George Orwell, wrote his novel, <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u>, 

educated  people across the free world have peered ahead to those 

four ominous digits, "1984," in intense dread and foreboding.  In 

Orwell's account of the fateful year, all the freedoms previously 

enjoyed;   speech,   press,  assembly,  and  even  thought,  have 

vanished.   The  giant nation known as Oceania is locked  in  the 

iron  grip of the omnipotent Party.   Every motion and every word 

of   every  individual  is  scrupulously  monitored  by   two-way 

telescreens.  Everywhere, immense portraits of the Party's leader 

stare  down  on the inhabitants of Oceania.   The  portraits  are 

accompanied  by  the  words,  "BIG   BROTHER  IS  WATCHING  YOU."  

Individuals who fail to act,  speak,  or even think in the proper 

way  are promptly disposed of by the thought  police,  tried  for 

thoughtcrime, then disappear forever.

     For  several  years,  as the nineteen  eighties  approached, 

people everywhere held their breath and, when 1984 passes without 

the  appearance  of  Big Brother,  everyone breathed  a  sigh  of 

relief.   But  lest  we cling too triumphantly to the  fact  that 

there are no telescreens watching our every move,  and no thought 

police disposing of thought criminals, we should examine the real 

meaning  of Orwell's <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u>.   Before Orwell  wrote 

<u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u>, he recognized many threatening developments 

in  the  Socialist party as well as government  in  general.   He 

recognized  these  developments as dangerous forces  which  could 

eventually   lead  to  world-wide  totalitarianism  and  complete 

suffocation of free thought.  Although the society of today bears 

little resemblance to Oceania,  we are still plagued by political 

and  philosophic  dogmas which threaten to arrest  all  freedoms.  

George Orwell wrote <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u> in 1948 as a  satire,  a 

warning  of what may come;  to that purpose,  the novel can still 

serve us well, in 1985 and beyond.
     
     As  a journalist,  George Orwell was a strong  supporter  of 

Socialism,  he  was also,  however,  a staunch critic of the same 

ideology.  Orwell watched, in disgust, the rise and proliferation 

of Communist Russia. According to educational filmstrip producer, 

Thomas S.  Klise,  Orwell wrote his novel <u>Animal Farm</u> as a brutal 

and  powerful  criticism  of the  Russian  Communist  revolution.  

Klise  explains  that  the  book also  criticizes  all  forms  of 

totalitarian  control.   Klise indicates that Orwell  was  deeply 

concerned  that  Socialism,  as  it existed  in  his  day,  might 

possibly  mushroom  until  it  smothered all  freedom.<sup>1</sup>   On  the 

surface, <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u> appears to be solely a criticism of 

Socialism.   Erich Fromm states,  however, that "it would be most 

unfortunate  if  the  reader smugly interpreted  <u>1984</u>  as  [only] 

another  description of Stalinist barbarism,  and if he does  not 

see that it means us, too."<sup>2</sup>  Thus, <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u> does not 

criticize Socialism,  Communism,  or Stalinism specifically,  but 

rather  warns  against  the  dangerous  flaws  inherent  in   all 

societies   and  governments  world-wide,   whether  fascist   or 

democratic.




     The  initial  observation made by many critics  of  <u>Nineteen 

Eighty-Four</u>  is that the novel,  being a prophecy,  has failed in 

that,  its major task.   Such critics will point out that, unlike 

Oceania,  we have retained freedom of thought and  individuality.  

Even  in Russia,  the state,  very little actually resembles  the 

totalitarian  terror  of  Oceania.   Others state  that  <u>Nineteen 

Eighty-Four</u>  failed  as  a prophecy because  it  succeeded  as  a 

warning.   Whatever  the apparent reason,  it is easy now to look 

back at Orwell's novel,  once regarded with dread and foreboding, 

and smile,  patting ourselves on the back for skillfully averting 

such  a  catastrophe of society.   If  <u>Nineteen  Eighty-Four</u>  has 

served successfully as a warning all these years, it is important 

that  we  do not now fail to continue taking it  as  such.   Even 

though 1984 has come and gone,  as Walter Cronkite writes,  there 

is always 1985 (and beyond).<sup>3</sup>



     To  understand Orwell's real message behind <u>Nineteen Eighty-

Four</u>, it is first necessary to realize his purpose in writing it.  

According  to Bernard Crick,  Professor of Political  Science  at 

Birkbeck  College  in  the University of  London,  Orwell  wanted 

"Nineteen  Eighty-Four" to be spelled out rather than in  numeral 

form, simply because the novel is a piece of literature and not a 

date  on the calendar.<sup>4</sup>  Winston Smith himself is not  sure  what 

day  it is,  nor is he even sure that it is indeed the year 1984.  

For  all Winston knows it could be   1988,  or  1990.   Thus,  we 

should hold <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u> in no lesser regard just because 

the year specified has come and gone.   In his essay, "From Bingo 

to  Big  Brother",   Gorman  Beauchamp,  Associate  Professor  of 

Humanities  at  the University of  Michigan,  writes:   "Nineteen 

Eighty-Four belongs to the literary genre called the  anti-utopia 

or dystopia, an extrapolation of certain negative features of the 

author's  own day into the future.   The dystopia functions as  a 

<u>Gendankenversuch</u>  or `what if' novelistic formula that allows for 

the  spinning out of speculative possibilities to their  ultimate 

conclusion."<sup>5</sup> The dangers of power-lust and thought control which 

Orwell  saw approaching in 1948 are even more threatening  today.  

Thus,  the  warning in <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u> is more valuable  now 

than  it was thirty-five years ago.   Defending  himself  against 

critics who attack his book as a faulty prophecy, Orwell writes: 

          "It  has  been  suggested  by  some  of   the 
         reviewers  of <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u> that it  is 
         the author's view that this, or something like 
         this,  is  what  will happen inside  the  next 
         forty years in the Western World.  This is not 
         correct.   I think that, allowing for the book 
         being  after  all  a  parody,  something  like 
         <u>Nineteen  Eighty-Four</u> <u>could</u> happen.   This  is 
         the  direction in which the world is going  at 
         the  present time,  and the trend lies deep in 
         the political, social and economic foundations 
         of    the   contemporary   world    situation.  
         Specifically, the danger lies in the structure 
         imposed   on   Socialists   and   on   Liberal 
         capitalist  communities  by the  necessity  to 
         prepare  for total war with the  U.S.S.R.  and 
         the new weapons, of which of course the atomic 
         bomb  is  the  most  powerful  and  the   most 
         publicized.   But  danger  lies  also  in  the 
         acceptance   of  a  totalitarian  outlook   by 
         intellectuals of all sorts. 
               "The   moral   to  be  drawn  from   the 
         dangerous nightmare situation is a simple one: 
         don't let it happen.   It depends in  you."<sup>6</sup>


     The  idea that <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u> need not actually happen 

to  be  valid  as a satirical  warning,  is  championed  by  V.S. 

Pritchet who writes in his review:

         Mr.  Orwell's book is a satirical pamphlet.  I 
         notice  that some critics have said  that  his 
         prophecy is not probable.  Neither was Swift's 
         <u>Modest  Proposal</u>  nor  Well's  <u>Island  of  Dr. 
         Moreau</u>.    Probability   is  not  a  necessary 
         condition of satire which, when it pretends to 
         draw the future,  is,  in fact,  scourging the 
         present.<sup>7</sup>



     It  is  insufficient to say that Oceania is  a  totalitarian 

state.   It  is a world were every action,  every word and  every 

thought is controlled by the Party.   The Party wields pure power 

through  its  use  of  telescreens,   thought  police,   and  the 

constriction  of  thought,  made possible by the introduction  of 

Newspeak.   As Winston Smith writes in his diary,  he understands 

how the party exercises total power,  but he cannot fathom why it 

should  choose to do so.   Winston gets his answer  when  O'Brien 

explains  to him in the Ministry of Love:  "The party seeks power 

entirely for its own sake."<sup>8</sup>  O'Brien explains that, unlike early 

totalitarian  regimes that made excuses for their  having  seized 

total power,  the Party openly realizes that power is, in itself, 

not  a  means but an end.   The Party craves power for  the  sole 

purpose  of  persecuting and trampling on its  subjects.   Orwell 

states that power and sadism are intertwined:  

         "Fascism is often loosely equated with sadism, 
         but  nearly  always by people who see  nothing 
         wrong  in the most slavish worship of  Stalin.  
         The truth is,  of course,  that the  countless 
         intellectuals  who kiss the arse of Stalin are 
         not different from the minority who gave their 
         allegiance  to Hitler or  Mussolini  ...  [or] 
         German militarism.  All of them are worshiping 
         power and successful cruelty.  It is important 
         to  notice that the cult of power tends to  be 
         mixed up with a love of cruelty and wickedness 
         <u>for their own sakes</u>."<sup>9</sup>


     It  is easy to see,  therefore,  that Oceania can  or  might 

exist  because the love of power,  which is bonded to the delight 

in cruelty, exists and is an ever-present force in our world.  It 

is  certainly easy to point out examples of power and  sadism  in 

Nazi  Germany and the Soviet Union,  but it must be realized that 

such barbaric tendencies also exist in the free world.   Oceania, 

after all, exists in North America and Britain.  Gorman Beauchamp 

relates  a  theme  from Orwell's  "Raffles  and  Miss  Blandish", 

another essay dealing with sadism and power:  "Orwell's point ... 

is  that the cult of power,  with its love of cruelty for its own 

sake,  is  in no wise peculiar to totalitarian regimes  -- though 

most obvious there, since its manifestations are writ so large -- 

but had become a persuasive feature of twentieth century life."<sup>10</sup>  

     Beauchamp  also  noted that Orwell held America to  have  no 

less a love for cruelty.   Orwell commented on cruelty in America 

by criticizing "Yank Mags" which presented the reader with bloody 

accounts  of  all-out  "jump-on-his-testicles"  fights.    Orwell 

comments  that such writings "would have little appeal except  to 

sadists  and masochists."<sup>11</sup>  In other writings,  Orwell  explains 

that virtually no one is free from the lust for power: 

         "People  worship  power in the form  in  which 
         they  are able to understand  it.   A  twelve-
         year-old   boy  worships  Jack  Dempsey.    An 
         adolescent  in  a  Glasgow  slum  worships  Al 
         Capone.   An  aspiring  pupil  at  a  business 
         college   worships  Lord  Nuffield.    A   <u>New 
         Statesman</u> reader worships Stalin.   There is a 
         difference in intellectual maturity,  but none 
         in moral outlook."<sup>12</sup>  

     The  terrifying  and unreal world of Oceania looks  all  the 

more  possible when the universal lust for power and  delight  in 

cruelty is considered.  There are, however, certain human virtues 

which  must  be  destroyed  in order to  establish  an  Orwellian 

society,  these  being trust,  love,  and individuality.   It  is 

precisely   these  qualities  which  Oceania   has   successfully 

eliminated.



     As  long as Winston and Julia retain their love and trust in 

one another, they are victorious over the Party.  Even though the 

Party  may  control  their  lives,  their  love  preserves  their 

humanity  and  gives them freedom.  According to  Bernard  Crick, 

"Mutual trust is that virtue praised by Aristotle, asserted to be 

necessary to true citizens and the very thing that a tyrant  must 

smash  if  he is to perpetuate his rule  successfully."<sup>13</sup>   Crick 

asserts that,  "while we have someone to trust, our individuality 

cannot  be destroyed.   For man is a social animal,  our identity 

arising from interaction,  not autonomy."<sup>14</sup>  Crick explains  that 

the Party is triumphant only when, in the cellars of the Ministry 

of Love,  it manages to destroy Smith's love for Julia and render 

him utterly alone.   The Party is successful when it destroys all 

trust    and    personal    relationships,    thus    eliminating 

individuality.<sup>15</sup>   O'Brien tells Winston,  "We have cut the links 

between child and parent,  between man and man,  and between  man 

and woman.   No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any 

longer."<sup>16</sup>    Winston's  betrayal  of  Julia  is  an  example  of 

O'Brien's theory.   Winston no longer loves Julia,  so he devotes 

all  his loyalty to Big Brother and the Party.   He becomes  only 

one of the millions who act,  think,  and feel exactly like  him.  

The Party gained power by killing trust and relationships.   Even 

today  our society becomes more like Oceania as the family system 

dissolves and marriages become more and more transient.  As crime 

increases,    trust   decreases.    To   maintain   freedom   and 

individuality,   trust   and  personal  relationships   must   be 

preserved.    In  <u>Nineteen  Eighty-Four</u>,   only  the  Proles  are 

successful in this respect: 

         "What  mattered were individual relationships, 
         and  the  completely  helpless   gesture,   an 
         embrace, a tear, a word spoken to a dying man, 
         could have value in itself... [The Proles] had 
         remained  in  this condition.   They were  not 
         loyal  to  a party or to a country  or  to  an 
         idea,  they  were  loyal to one  another...the 
         Proles  had  stayed  human.    They  had   not 
         hardened  inside.   They  had held on  to  the 
         primitive emotions..."<sup>17</sup>

Winston  realizes that any real hope for the future lies  in  the 

Proles.  We must learn appreciate what the Proles hold so dear if 

we hope to remain human.



     The  Party's  slogan "IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH" indicates  that 

the  Party  derives much of its power by keeping  the  truth  and 

facts  from the individuals.   It does this by rewriting history.  

In this way, the citizens of Oceania have absolutely no idea what 

has  actually  happened in the past.   Even  their  memories  are 

manipulated through the process of Doublethink,  whereby thoughts 

contrary  to  the  doctrines  of the Party  are  immediately  and 

completely forgotten.   Even the workers in the Ministry of Truth 

are required to forget the very acts of forgery they commit every 

day while altering history.   Those who cling to their own  ideas 

and  memories are accused of thoughtcrime and suffer the fate  of 

Winston Smith.   Although it certainly cannot be argued that such 

a system of history and memory control would be of infinite value 

to  a totalitarian regime,  it may be doubted that the process is 

actually  possible.   The  Soviet Union has  proven  that  memory 

control  is possible.   Bernard Crick points out that the  <u>Soviet 

Encyclopedia</u>  first depicted Trotsky as a hero of the civil  war, 

then,  when he had fallen out of favor, a later addition made him 

an  agent of the Mensheviks.   Then in a very bold yet tidy  way, 

the  encyclopedia  deleted  him altogether,  making him  an  "un-

person".<sup>18</sup>  

     Not  only is memory control possible and,  as we have  seen, 

actually  been used in the modern world,  it is highly  practical 

for the totalitarian regime.   Orwell writes in a pre  - <u>Nineteen 

Eighty-Four</u> essay: 

         "From the totalitarian point of view,  history 
         is   something  to  be  created  rather   than 
         learned.   A totalitarian state is in effect a 
         theocracy,  and its ruling caste,  in order to 
         keep  its  position,  has to be thought of  as 
         infallible.  But since, in practice, no one is 
         infallible,  it is frequently necessary to re-
         arrange past events in order to show that this 
         or that mistake was not made,  or that this or 
         that  imaginary  triumph  actually   happened. 
         ...Totalitarianism  demands,   in  fact,   the 
         continuous alteration of the past,  and in the 
         long  run probably demands a disbelief in  the 
         very  existence  of objective truth."<sup>19</sup>

  
     The  very  methods  of memory control depicted  in  <u>Nineteen 

Eighty-Four</u> are,  to a degree,  possible in present-day  society.  

The  Ministry-of-Truth-like manipulation of facts promises to  be 

even  more feasible with the advent of computers and the  storage 

of  vast  quantities of information as magnetic charges and  tiny 

optical  specks.  Norman Lear,  television producer and  founding 

chairman of People for the American Way,  recently  stated,  "Big 

Brother  has  arrived,  and he is your computer!"<sup>20</sup>  It may  soon 

prove possible to delete or modify large portions of history with 

the touch of a few buttons, a method of which Winston Smith could 

never even have dreamed.  Senator and Former Astronaut John Glenn 

summed up the problem when he wrote: 

         "We  have made tremendous advances in computer 
         science,  communications,  genetics and  other 
         sciences,  advances  that could  significantly 
         enhance our lives.  But, if we're not careful, 
         they  could  also  threaten to  undermine  our 
         basic principles and values."<sup>21</sup>



     The dangers which Orwell feared have existed for over  forty 

years.   Recently,  however,  rapid  developments  in the  United 

States  and the entire world have made the threat of an  Oceania-

like  society  even more relevant.   Today we see more  and  more 

nations world-wide beginning to resemble Oceania.  Annie Gottlieb 

writes in <u>McCall's</u> magazine:

         "We  in  the United States aren't spied on  by 
         "Thought Police",  true... but citizens of the 
         Soviet  Union  are.   We aren't  watched  from 
         every wall by huge posters of our leader, "Big 
         Brother"...    but   in   Communist   Romania, 
         President  Ceausescu's picture is  everywhere.  
         People  here don't disappear without  a  trace 
         because  of suspect political  beliefs...  but 
         that has happened in Argentina.  U.S. citizens 
         aren't  jailed  and tortured for thinking  for 
         themselves...  but it's happening right now in 
         South Africa, Iran, the Philippines, and about 
         120  other  countries,  according  to  Amnesty 
         International.  When you look around the whole 
         globe in 1984,  not just at the United States, 
         it begins to seem as if a rare ray of light is 
         shining on us while much of the world is dark.  
         And  even  in our own society  some  observers 
         discern growing patches of shadow."<sup>22</sup>




     In  an  article for <u>Maclean's</u>,  a  Canadian  news  magazine, 

Micheal  Harrington examines political and economic forces in the 

United  States,  Canada,  and Great Britain which are tending  to 

change the West into Orwell's Oceania.  Harrington explains that, 

rather  than  simply presenting a satire on life  in  the  Soviet 

Union,  <u>Nineteen  Eighty-Four</u>  deals expressly with  problems  in 

Western society.   "The totalitarianism it describes is explained 

as  the  outcome of a dynamic within Western  society  itself."<sup>23</sup>  

The  Party  in Oceania,  not unlike the Communist regime  of  the 

Soviet  Union,  is  powerful because all political  and  economic 

power  are  fused and controlled by a small minority in a  system 

called  Bureaucratic or  Oligarchical  Collectivism.   Harrington 

warns  that  the  United  States and its Western  allies  may  be 

forming just such a political and economic order.  He writes that 

the world economic crisis,  the radical changes in the world-wide 

division of labor,  deunionization,  the multinationalization  of 

corporate  power,  and  the technological revolution are  causing 

every  Western  government to play a greater  directing  role  in 

industry.    As   government   and  the  industry   become   one, 

Bureaucratic Collectivism becomes more than a nightmare.<sup>24</sup>



     A  Totalitarian society like Oceania can only be born if all 

the power of the state can somehow be seized by a small number of 

individuals.   Even  in the United States,  we are in  danger  of 

domination by a "privileged few."  The Reverend Jesse L. Jackson, 

president  of Operation PUSH (People United to Save Humanity) and 

one-time Democratic Presidential Candidate, writes:

         "We've always  had  a real  fight  in  America 
         between an Aristocracy and a  Democracy.   Why 
         are  the  elections on  Tuesday,  rather  than 
         Saturday,  when it's more convenient?  Why are 
         you  not registered automatically as a citizen 
         so  you don't have to go to all  that  trouble 
         just to vote?  That's the Aristocratic streak.  
         It's an attempt to keep the masses away.   And 
         as  a result,  we have one of the lowest voter 
         turnouts of any Democracy."<sup>25</sup>



     Ever since the days of Franklin Roosevelt, the President has 

enjoyed increasing power over the citizens of America.  Today the 

government continues to tighten its grip on the actions and  even 

the  thoughts  of its  constituents.   Jesse  Jackson  identifies 

several such tendencies in our society:

         "This  administration fights for the right  of 
         the government to spy, to tap telephones.  The 
         computer  network is being used more and  more 
         to monitor people's behavior."<sup>26</sup>



     Melor Sturua,  a Soviet news correspondent, demands that the 

government  of the U.S.  far exceeds that of the Soviet Union  as 

being most Orwellian.

             "The  U.S.  National Security Agency (NSA) 
         is  the  indisputable top  contender  for  the 
         title   of   `Big  Brother.'    In   technical 
         equipment,  material resources,  and personnel 
         it  exceeds  all other such American  agencies 
         combined.  Unified by a computerized umbilical 
         cord with the Central Intelligence Agency, the 
         Federal  Bureau of  Investigation,  and  other 
         `Big   Brothers,'its   electronic   detectives 
         observe  literally  every  American  and  know 
         everything  about  him.  Uncle Sam listens  to 
         telephone  conversations,   reads  mail,   and 
         monitors movements and thought.
           This `technotyranny' cancels out the  famous 
         Fourth  Amendment  to the  U.S.  Constitution, 
         which  guarantees the right of people  `to  be 
         secure in their persons,  houses,  papers, and 
         effects.'    This   is  in  a  country   whose 
         government,  according to <u>Parade</u> magazine, has 
         6,723 varieties of card files on its citizens, 
         containing 3.9 billion dossiers for every man, 
         woman, and child."<sup>27</sup>


     Sturua  also  points out that besides copying  many  of  the 

Party's  tactics,  the  government of the United States  actually 

prescribes to the very political doctrine of Oceania.

         "In  the utopian world of  <u>Nineteen  Eighty-
         Four</u>,  offices  hold a daily Two Minutes  Hate 
         and  the government sponsors Hate  Weeks.  One 
         cannot  help  recalling  the  devil's  sabbath 
         raised  in  the  West in connection  with  the 
         provocative South Korean spy plane.  That  was 
         Hate Month."<sup>28</sup>



     The  slogan of the Party,  "WAR IS PEACE,"  initially  seems 

ludicrous  and  almost humorous to the reader.   The humor  fades 

into repulsion,  however, as it becomes clear that the military's 

theory  of  escalating  the build-up of nuclear  weapons  in  the 

preparation for bi-lateral disarmament is equally ludicrous.  Dr. 

Helen  Caldicott,  President  Emeritus of Physicians  for  Social 

Responsibility   and  founder  of  Women's  Action  for   Nuclear 

Disarmament,  points  out that the slogan "WAR IS PEACE" is  used 

fervently by the present administration.  Caldicott explains that 

weapons of mass destruction like "Peacekeeper",  the MX  missile, 

have  cost  the nation approximately one trillion dollars in  the 

last  thirty-eight years.   She reminds us that in the next  five 

years,  the  government  plans  to spend half  a  trillion  more.  

Caldicott  stresses that such price tags for mass  slaughter  are 

breaking the back of the nation's economy,  "just as Oceania used 

war  making  preparations as a way to drain off the  economy  and 

keep  people  working.   They  call  it `defense,'  but  its  not 

defense. It's <u>war</u>."<sup>29</sup>

     When  it comes to strategic weapons,  the government of  the 

United  States  is  extremely  fluent  in  both  Doublethink  and 

Newspeak.  Micheal Harrington cites one example:

         "Back  in  the  1960's,   Washington  got  the 
         brilliant idea to put a march on the  Soviets: 
         the  United States would `MIRV' its missiles-- 
         that   is,   fit   them  out   with   Multiple 
         Independently   targeted  Re-entry   Vehicles.  
         That phrase,  with its Orwellian Newspeak  and 
         Doublethink, is a delicate way of referring to 
         clusters of city-destroying nuclear bombs."<sup>27</sup>




     The Party keeps precise tabs on its citizens through the use 

of telescreens.   Micheal Harrington reminds us that although  we 

need not fear the eye of a constantly watching television camera, 

our  Western  governments may have found more effective and  more 

subtle modes of observation:

       "Consider the social insurance number. It began, 
       innocently  enough  as an identification  number 
       for  the  computing  of  government   retirement 
       benefits.    It   has  now  become  a  universal 
       citizen's  number  that  gives  access  to   the 
       enormous data banks about every citizen.   It is 
       used   by  banks,   universities,   credit  card 
       companies,   intelligence  services,   tax   and 
       immigration  authorities...  A television camera 
       in one's living room as obtrusive,  obvious,  to 
       be  resented.   A  social  insurance  number  is 
       functional,   innocuous  <u>and</u>  the  means  of   a 
       computerized surveillance of the individual."<sup>31</sup> 
       


     It  is  certainly  true that  our  present-day  world  comes 

immensely  short  of  actually concretely  resembling  the  gross 

totalitarianism depicted in <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u>.  However, if we 

care  enough  to  fear the nightmare world of  Winston  Smith  in 

Oceania,   we   must  strive  to  eliminate  even  the   remotest 

similarities  to  Orwell's  vision  that exist  in  our  society.  

George Orwell created Oceania from frightening aspects of society 

which existed in 1948.  Though it is now 1985, these aspects, the 

lust  for power and the destruction of the individual  and  human 

relationships,  still exist.  The possibility of mind control and 

history  alteration are becoming increasingly more feasible.   It 

was Orwell's intent that we might recognize what these tendencies 

might  one day blossom into and arrest them before we  are,  like 

Winston Smith,  huddling in an alcove, struggling to think freely 

at last.

                          <em>   OUTLINE  </em>
     




THESIS:  Although  the  society of today  bears  little 
         resemblance  to Oceania,  we are still plagued 
         by  political  and  philosophic  dogmas  which 
         threaten  to  arrest  all  freedoms.    George 
         Orwell wrote <u>Nineteen Eighty-Four</u> in 1948 as a 
         satire,  a warning of what may come;  to  that 
         purpose, the novel can still serve us well, in 
         1985 and beyond.
